      <h1>Meeting 1 Synopsis</h1>
      <h2>September 2, 2015</h2>
      <p class = "bodyp">Cottonwood's NHS chapter is preparing for the new school year. This meeting is a brief, informal introduction to the organization and its requirements. More information will be covered in detail at the formal induction, set to occur on an as-yet-unknown date in September. You can contact Cottonwood's NHS chapter by email (<a href = "mailto:help@cottonwoodnhs.org">help@cottonwoodnhs.org</a>) or through Twitter (<a href = "https://twitter.com/cottonwoodnhs">@CottonwoodNHS</a>). Information will be posted online and sent by text to mailing list subscribers. To join the list and receive updates by text message, text @chs15nhs to 81010.</p>
      <p class = "bodyp">Yearly requirements have been changed; individual service hours need not be organized by you. You may complete them in groups or at existing organizations (such as an animal shelter or food bank). Additional details will be provided at the formal induction. Tutoring will be offered more frequently, and will be available in a variety of subjects to accommodate all members.</p>
      <p class = "bodyp">The first service project offered by Cottonwood's National Honor Society chapter will occur on September 22; we will be meeting at Cottonwood and helping to clean the school. Though only one service project is required each quarter, we will offer them twice each month to assist those who may have busy schedules.</p>
      <p class = "bodyp">For returning (or new) seniors, last year's requirements must still be completed to graduate with honors. These must be done in the same manner as last year; for example, individual service hours must be planned and organized by you. The requirements for junior year must be finished by the end of the year, and considerable forethought will be required to complete both years' requirements in a timely manner. Additional information is to be covered at the formal induction.</p>
      <p>Welcome to Cottonwood's National Honor Society chapter. We look forward to working with you!</p>
