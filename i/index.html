      <p class = "bodyo">If you're a junior who is joining the National Honor Society starting second semester, there is a meeting after school on Wednesday, February 17. Please come to room 101 as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">We are volunteering with the Utah Food Bank (3150 S 900 W) on Thursday, February 18 from 7:30 to 9:00 p.m. If you signed up for the event at the last meeting, please come!</p>

      <p class = "bodyo">The website has been reconfigured to reflect third quarter's data. Far fewer people are on probation third quarter than were second quarter; including the members that were removed from the organization, the number has halved.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">We will be volunteering with the Festival of Trees this year. This event has been held for forty-five years, raising millions of dollars for Primary Children's Hospital. This year, it will be held at South Towne Expo Center (9575 S State St). National Honor Society officers will be present on Friday, December 4, from 7:00 to 10:00 p.m. (we will be meeting near the entrance to the building on this date). However, you may volunteer on any of the other days to be credited for attending the activity. Please obtain proof that you attended. Volunteers are expected to arrive 25 minutes early and dress formally (shirts, ties, and slacks; dresses). You should behave well and put your cell phone away for the duration of the event. Carpooling is encouraged, as parking is limited. We need a number of parent chaperones to accompany volunteers. If your parents attend with you, you will be credited with an additional activity.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">There will be a clothing drive from Wednesday, November 11 to Tuesday, November 24. Please bring gently-used clothing to Ms. Richey (room 128) during this time. This will count as an activity for the quarter. Be sure to record that you brought items to ensure you receive credit.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">Seventy-six percent of our chapter's members are on probation. Any requirements that were missed last quarter must be made up this quarter; those who fail to complete them will be removed from the organization. The party for those who are not on probation will be held on Friday, November 13. Further details will be sent by text and posted on Twitter. If you have already made up any requirements you missed last quarter, you may still attend the party; show proof that you've finished them to be admitted.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">We will be volunteering at the Humane Society of Utah (4242 S 300 W) on Wednesday, November 11, from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. Space is limited, so we ask that only those who signed up attend the event.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">We will be planting trees with TreeUtah on Saturday, October 24. This event will be held at Woodstock Meadows Park (5860 S 1051 E) from 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon. Those interested in volunteering must register with the organization. Space is limited, so register in a timely manner to ensure a spot. Please consider scheduling conflicts that may occur with the October ACT on the same date.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">We will be writing letters to men and women serving in the military on Tuesday, October 20. This will be held in Cottonwood's inner courtyard immediately after school. It is expected to finish around 3:45 p.m.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">The next meeting is on Thursday, October 1. It will be held after school in room 101. All members should attend, but it is especially important for those who missed the formal induction.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">The next service project, for those who signed up at the induction, will be with Special Olympics Utah. We will be meeting at West High School (241 N 300 W) on Saturday, October 3 at 8:00 a.m. We are expecting to finish at 12:00 noon.</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">Our formal induction will be held on Thursday, September 24. We will be meeting in room 101 at 6:00 p.m. Ted Eyre, mayor of Murray City, will be addressing the chapter. This meeting is mandatory for all members, but especially important for those who missed the introduction. Formal attire (dresses, shirts and ties) is recommended. Parents are welcome, but do not need to attend the induction. Light refreshments will be served. We hope to see you there!</p>
      <p class = "bodyo">The first service project of the year will be on Tuesday, September 22. We are meeting at Cottonwood's main entrance at 5:00 p.m. and working with the janitorial staff to clean the school.
